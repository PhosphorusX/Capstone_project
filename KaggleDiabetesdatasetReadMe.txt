Description
Basic Explanation

It is important to know if a patient will be readmitted in some hospital. The reason is that you can change the treatment, in order to avoid a readmission.

In this database, you have 3 different outputs:

    No readmission;
    A readmission in less than 30 days (this situation is not good, because maybe your treatment was not appropriate);
    A readmission in more than 30 days (this one is not so good as well the last one, however, the reason can be the state of the patient.

In this context, you can see different objective functions for the problem. You can try to figure out situations where the patient will not be readmitted, or if their are going to be readmitted in less than 30 days (because the problem can the the treatment), etc... Make your choice and let's help them creating new approaches for the problem.
